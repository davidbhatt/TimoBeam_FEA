# TimoBeam_FEA
This repo consists of Wolfram language code to carry out frequency analysis of a rotating Beam using Euler and Timoshenko Theory in either 2D or 3D plane
This code includes the modules for vibration analysis of a rotating tapered Timoshenko Beam using finite beam element method
The method is outlined in the paper
A.Bazoune and Y.A.Khulief,"A finite beam element for vibration analysis of rotating tapered timoshenko beams",J.Sound Vib.,vol.156,no.1,pp.141-164,1992,doi:10.1016/0022-460X(92)90817-H.

For 2D analytical expressions for stiffness matrices are also avalable and they tally to that of paper
For 3D beam, numerical evaluation of matrices and eigenvalues is used.

Detailed description is given in first few lines of the code and induvidual Readme files
